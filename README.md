# dumb-hop-protocol
Dumb Hop Protocol is a research experiment aimed at dynamically building the best network path before a transmission between source and destination begins.
The basic principal is to choose hops based on the lowest link saturation value (transmissions already on the link). In doing so we reduce the need for high cost, high bandwidth links
and replace them with many low cost lower bandwidth links. We construct the network topology as a partial mesh grid whereby the only artificial pre knowledge known to the protocal
